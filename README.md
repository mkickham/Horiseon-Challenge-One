# Horiseon-Challenge-One

# Description
This website is created for Horiseon Social Media Solutions. It contains a navigation bar at the top with working links that navigate you to the relevant criteria on the page. It also contains additional information throughout the page about the offerings of Horiseon Inc. I first changed the title of the website from "Title" to "Horiseon Social Solutions. I then changed a div element to a header, although I also considered instead changing it to a nav element. Next I changed another div element to a section element. For each picture, I added and "alt" element to give it a description. I changed the side graphic from a div element to an aside element. Finally, I changed the code at the end from a div element to a footer. Throughout the index, I annotated all my code.
